# Aframe_Multiuser_Interaction

This game involves two players competing or cooperating to catch 'xenos'. You use your mouse to look around and wasd to move.  Hit xenos with the staff to score points. I set out with the goal of intergrating 'Networked-Aframe' into this project as we want to use it for our term project.  I also wanted to see if I could familiarise myself with some of the design patterns involved with Aframe such as the gamestate and entity systems.  Overall I think I bit off far more than I could chew.

The element that made this assignment challenging overall is my lack of familiarity with JavaScript.  I find that I spend a lot of time debugging and using trial and error to get tasks complete.  Networked Aframe also proved to be a challenge in that it was difficult to figure out what elements should be 'networked' rather than local instances, though it is great when it works.  Intergrating the 'gamestate' system with Networked Aframe was also difficult, and the final outcome is not very clean.

Not really sure what went well, but it kind of works, and I definitely learned a lot.
